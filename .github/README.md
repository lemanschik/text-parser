# text-parser
I need to Collect all Text Parsing algos into a single Repo as else we double and double the work

## Importent
All this stuff exists because of legacy bloat it is not usefull for current projects
All this needs to get used to transpile legacy projects into a clean maintainable state to depend on and develop with.

It is a wrong assumption that you should use anything of that in production maybe but only maybe the bundler parts.
Until better exist. 

In general as all this are Text Character Data based tools that produce UTF-16 Text Character Data to get used in WInterOP Environments.
In general it is a wrong asuumption that you save time and get better production results when you adopt 3th party formats and transpile them.

The Most best results get archived via Usage of RAW CSS HTML and JS where you should use JS To Produce HTML and CSS at Scale as also link it
where it is needed. Additional you get Hooks for JS via HTML and Service Workers eg: HTML defined import maps and serviceWorker defined custom
responses to load events of the JS Engine via fetch.
