# Vite
a Rollup based text parser mainly plugins on top of the rollup parser to handle more situations with sane defaults.
Adjusted to use NodeJS

It mainly adds hot module reload thats the only thing 

# Cons
- a lot of cons it is using a lot of legacy tooling in a wrong way to archive its results 
- It is a bad copy of donejs and the stealjs loader 5 steps back
